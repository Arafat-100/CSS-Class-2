        <p>Arsenal's lack of a natural goalscorer up front has been scrutinised during their downturn in form and the fact it was one of his defenders that ended a barren run in front of goal will remain a concern for Arteta.
            No side has scored more goals from set pieces in the Premier League this season than Arsenal and it was two corners that undid Palace before half-time.
            Gabriel outmuscled Chris Richards to rise highest to meet Declan Rice's delivery with a downward header to settle the home side's nerves just 11 minutes in.
            Palace were largely restricted to pot shots from long range as Jefferson Lerma tested David Raya after the goalkeeper's poor clearance gifted possession to the Colombian.
            But they did not learn their lesson as Gabriel again got ahead of Richards to meet Bukayo Saka's corner and the ball rebounded in off the unfortunate Henderson.
            Hodgson was booed by his own fans after substituting Eberechi Eze during Wednesday's 1-0 FA Cup defeat at Everton to keep the England international fresh for the trip to the Emirates.
            The closest Eze came to mak. Arsenal's lack of a natural goalscorer up front has been scrutinised during their downturn in form and the fact it was one of his defenders that ended a barren run in front of goal will remain a concern for Arteta.
